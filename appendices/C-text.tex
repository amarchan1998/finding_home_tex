\section{APPENDIX C: COUNTRY LISTS FOR REDUCED SAMPLES}
\label{sec:C}
\subsection{North Africa and Middle East countries}
The model in column 5 of Table \ref{tab:2} estimates coefficients for a linear model with a sample that only considers countries outside of the Middle East and North Africa, a region defined in the World Bank databases. The sample takes into account all countries for which the database includes dependent and independent variables' values which are not in this region. Thus, besides from countries with missing values, the model in column 5 of Table considers all countries in the World Bank datasets, \emph{except} the countries included in Table \ref{tab:mena}.
\subsection{Western Hemisphere countries}
The model in column 6 of Table \ref{tab:2}, also takes into account a reduced sample size, which solely considers the western hemisphere. The selection was done by the Author, and includes countries in Europe, the Americas and some countries of Oceania. Except countries with missing values on the $k$ covariates included in the model in column 6 of Table \ref{tab:2}, the countries which \emph{are} included in the sample size are shown in Table \ref{tab:west}.
